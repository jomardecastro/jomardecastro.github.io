									Argent for Compliance </h2>
								<p>Government regulations such as Sarbanes Oxley and HIPAA are changing the ways companies do business
									worldwide. Argent for Compliance collects, scans, and consolidates all critical data from across the
									worldwide enterprise into one or more centralized SQL Server and/or ODBC databases, regardless of the
									hardware platform. Argent for Compliance can process data residing on Windows, Linux, AIX, HP-UX, SCO,
									Solaris, iSeries, and SNMP devices.</p>
								<p>Argent for Compliance is completely scalable, extremely robust, and provides a complete audit trail
									for management. Now, companies can effectively comply with audit requests and initiate internal audits
									in response to “keywords” and behavior uncovered with a searchable centralized database.</p>

								</div>
								<p>In today’s unstable world, it is not a question of need — all companies and organizations require the
									security of data archiving and reporting.
									<br> Argent for Compliance comes with out-of-the-box <strong>Instant Best Practice</strong> Reporting
									for the following critical compliance acts:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Australian Privacy Act –<strong> APA</strong></li>
									<li>Criminal Justice Information Services Act –<strong> CJIS</strong></li>
									<li>Federal Information Security Management Act – <strong>FISMA</strong></li>
									<li>General Data Protection Regulation – <strong>GDPR</strong></li>
									<li>Graham-Leach-Bliley Act – <strong>GLBA</strong></li>
									<li>Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act – <strong>HIPAA</strong></li>
									<li>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard – <strong>PCI</strong></li>
									<li>Sarbanes-Oxley – <strong>SOX</strong></li>
								</ul>
								<p>Click Here For Sample Reports
									<br> Additionally, Argent for Compliance provides many features to ensure customers stay compliant:
								</p>
								<h3>Proactive Monitoring</h3>
								<p>Instead of waiting for issues to occur, Argent for Compliance allows customers to keep an eye on
									events as they are unfolding
									<br> For example, monitoring if there are numerous, repetitive Event ID 529s or 4625s allows
									administrators to take action, ban a user or IP address before a brute force hack becomes successful
									<br> Similarly, monitoring Linux/Unix message logs, SYSLOGs, IIS logs, SQL Server logs, and iSeries
									logs for warnings can prevent catastrophes before they have the chance of reaching a critical point
								</p>
								<div>With Argent’s 18 different Alert types and robust customization, customers can ensure they are
									notified well in advance</div>
								<h3>Data Archiving</h3>
								<p>All data relating to compliance needs to be retained with the capability of being analyzed.
									<br> With Event Logs (or any log for that matter), data bloat can become a major nightmare for daily
									backups, poor reporting performance, and just a general feeling that the data being collected is a
									complete mess to sort through
									<br> With Argent for Compliance, Security Logs are carefully and intelligently analyzed, and only the
									pertinent information is parsed into different fields in the database
									<br> The database structure has been carefully designed for maximum performance for reporting and
									minimizes the growth of the database
								</p>
								<h3>Instant Best Practice Reporting For All Compliance Acts</h3>
								<p>When an auditor arrives, Argent’s reports do the heavy lifting for customers
									<br> All reports are broken down by compliance act.
									<br> Reports can be scheduled automatically to provide administrators with full visibility on who,
									what, and where changes occurred
								</p>
								<h3>Scalability</h3>
								<p>Argent for Compliance has a true n-tier architecture, supporting from the smallest to the largest
									networks. Agents may be installed or all archiving can be done without installing any agents on the
									production servers; there is no difference in the price.</p>
								<div>All common hardware platforms, such as Windows, Linux, AIX, HP-UX, SCO, Solaris, and iSeries
									<br> Argent for Compliance can even archive the data from networking equipment like routers and
									switches.
								</div>
								<h3>Robust Design</h3>
								<p>Complete fault tolerance is engineered into Argent for Compliance to handle slow or erratic networks
									and hardware failures.
									<br> Trusted Agents can be replicated so if one server fails, another server immediately takes over
									the collecting, scanning, and consolidating of data.
								</p>
								<div>
									<p>Load balancing is provided to handle large amounts of data collection (in excess of 1,000 gigabytes
										per day).</p>
									<h3>Automation</h3>
									<p>Argent for Compliance has a built-in scheduler in order to optimize resource consumption. Customers
										can schedule data archiving in real-time, or only during the evenings, on the weekends, or at night,
										when network load is minimal.</p>
